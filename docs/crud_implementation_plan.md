# Generic CRUD System Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation and Directory Scaffolding

This phase prepares your project structure to house the new core systems in an organized and scalable manner.

- [x] Establish a dedicated core namespace and directory structure for the generic systems. Create the directory `app/Core/Crud/` to hold the system's non-Livewire PHP classes.
- [x] Create a corresponding namespace for the generic Livewire components at `app/Core/Crud/Livewire/`.
- [x] Create a dedicated directory for the generic components' Blade views at `resources/views/livewire/core/crud/` to keep them separate from application-specific views.
- [x] Create the primary directory for all model-specific configurations at `app/Crud/Configurations/`.

## Phase 2: Generic Component Implementation

This phase involves creating the "engine" of your CRUD systemâ€”the components that will do all the heavy lifting.

- [x] Create the generic `CrudIndex` Livewire component within the new `App\Core\Crud\Livewire` namespace. Its logic should be entirely driven by a configuration class, containing no references to specific models.
- [x] Develop the generic `CrudForm` Livewire component, also within the core namespace. This component will be responsible for dynamically rendering form fields and processing data based on its configuration.
- [x] Build the corresponding generic Blade views, `crud-index.blade.php` and `crud-form.blade.php`, inside `resources/views/livewire/core/crud/`. These views will contain the dynamic `@foreach` loops and `@switch` statements.

## Phase 3: The Configuration Layer

This phase defines the contract that makes the entire system work, ensuring consistency across all future implementations.

- [x] Define the `CrudConfigInterface` in the `app/Core/Crud/` directory. This interface will enforce the required methods (`getModelClass`, `getFields`, etc.) for any model's configuration.
- [x] Document each method in the `CrudConfigInterface` with docblocks, explaining its purpose and expected return type. This is crucial for future extensibility.

## Phase 4: Pilot Implementation and System Validation

This phase is the proof of concept, where you apply the system to a simple, real-world model to ensure everything is working as expected.

- [x] Use `Taxonomy` as the pilot model.
- [x] Implement the first concrete configuration class, `app/Crud/Configurations/TaxonomyCrudConfig.php`, ensuring it correctly implements the `CrudConfigInterface`.
- [x] Manually create a route pointing to the `CrudIndex` component, passing the `TagCrudConfig::class` to it, and thoroughly test all create, read, update, and delete functionalities.

## Phase 5: Advanced Feature Integration: File Uploads

This phase extends the system's capabilities by integrating the reusable file upload component.

- [ ] Create the self-contained, reusable `FileUploadComponent` and its Blade view within the core Livewire namespace (`app/Core/Crud/Livewire/` and `resources/views/livewire/core/crud/`).
- [ ] Refactor the generic `crud-form.blade.php` view to include a new 'file' type case in its `@switch` statement, which will render the `FileUploadComponent`.
- [ ] Enhance the generic `CrudForm` component's save method with the critical logic to detect, process, and permanently store `TemporaryUploadedFile` objects before saving the model data.
- [ ] Create a pilot model with an image field, such as `UserProfile` with an `avatar` field, and implement its `UserProfileCrudConfig` to validate the entire file upload and storage flow.

## Phase 6: Dynamic Routing and Navigation

This phase elevates the boilerplate from a collection of tools to a truly scalable platform by automating route and navigation registration.

- [x] Design a dynamic routing strategy in a new service provider, such as `CrudRouteServiceProvider.php`. This provider will scan the `app/Crud/Configurations` directory and automatically register the necessary CRUD routes for each configuration file found.
- [ ] Implement a dynamic navigation system, likely through a view composer or a dedicated navigation service. This system will also scan the configuration directory to generate sidebar links, using the `getEntityName()` method from each config to label the links appropriately.

## Phase 7: Documentation and Final Polish

This is the final and most critical phase for creating a high-quality, reusable boilerplate.

- [ ] Write clear, concise documentation in your project's `README.md` or dedicated documentation files. Detail exactly how an end-user can add a new, fully functional CRUD module to the boilerplate by following a simple checklist.
- [ ] Add comprehensive inline comments and docblocks to the generic components (`CrudIndex`, `CrudForm`, `FileUploadComponent`) and the `CrudConfigInterface`, explaining the "why" behind the architecture.
- [ ] Refine the boilerplate by removing any unnecessary test models, leaving only a single, well-documented configuration class (e.g., `TagCrudConfig.php`) to serve as a clean template for the user.
